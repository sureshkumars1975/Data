# Basic HTML Page

This folder contains a minimal HTML page for quick testing and demos.

Files added:
- `index.html` — main page
- `css/styles.css` — simple styles
- `js/script.js` — tiny script for button interaction

How to open:

- Open `index.html` directly in your browser.
- Or serve with Python (in this directory) and visit http://localhost:8000:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

If you want, I can commit these files and create a small demo branch. What would you like next?
